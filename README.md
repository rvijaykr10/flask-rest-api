README file for running Flask REST API using Docker:

Install Docker on your system if you haven't already done so.

Clone the repository or navigate to the directory where the Dockerfile is located.

Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Dockerfile is located.

Run the following command to build the Docker image:

docker build -t flask-rest-api .
Once the build process completes, start the container by running the following command:

docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-rest-api
Once the container starts, open a web browser and go to the following URL:

http://localhost:5000/
You should now see the home page of the Flask REST API.

You can now use the API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on the database.

When you're finished using the API, stop the container by pressing CTRL+C in the terminal window.

Note: This is a basic README file for running Flask REST API using Docker. You may need to modify it based on your specific needs and requirements.
